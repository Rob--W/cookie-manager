# Cookie Manager

This Cookie Manager allows you to quickly view and edit specific cookies.
It is designed to be compatible with Chrome, Firefox and Firefox for Android.

By default, the Cookie Manager opens when the extension starts up. This allows
you to keep the extension disabled until you need it.

You can also turn off the automatic opening, and manually open the cookie
manager by clicking on the extension button in the toolbar (desktop) or the
Cookie Manager menu item (Firefox for Android 55+).

Cookie Manager is created by Rob Wu <rob@robwu.nl> (https://robwu.nl/).
If you have suggestions or questions, open an issue at https://github.com/Rob--W/cookie-manager/issues or send me a mail.

## Searching for cookies
The Cookie Manager has a search form that allows you to filter on every possible
cookie field or flag. Only non-empty filters are used in the query.
Wildcards (`*`) can be used in each filter to match any text.

The list of results is **not** automatically updated. The "Search" button needs
to be clicked again to refresh the list of cookies.


## Keyboard shortcuts

Currently the UI is optimized for use on mobile, and support for keyboard shortcuts is limited to
the rows in the result table:

- <kbd>Arrow up</kbd> Focus the previous cookie row.
  * <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Arrow up</kbd> Focus the previous cookie row and
    extend the current selection (or lack thereof) to that row.
    This shortcut is ignored when text has been selected.
  * <kbd>Page up</kbd> and <kbd>Home</kbd> are also supported.
- <kbd>Arrow down</kbd> Focus the next cookie row.
  * <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Arrow down</kbd> Focus the next cookie row and
    extend the current selection (or lack thereof) to that row.
    This shortcut is ignored when text has been selected.
  * <kbd>Page down</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> are also supported.
- <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> Toggle selection of the focused row.
- <kbd>Delete</kbd> Remove the focused cookie.


## Bulk cookie selection
The Cookie Manager is optimized for the use case of selecting many cookies and
then removing them. Being able to quickly select specific cookies is important,
so there are multiple ways to select cookies.

Individual cookies can be added or removed from the selection by clicking on a
cookie row. All results can be selected by one click on the "Select all" button.

### Bulk selection by mouse
When you select text in the results with a mouse, and the text selection
contains two or more cookies, then two buttons appear near the mouse pointer:

- "Select *n* rows" - adds the cookie rows to the cookie selection.
- "Invert selection" - toggles the cookie selection of the cookie rows.

### Bulk selection by keyboard
Click on a cookie and use arrow up/down to go to the previous/next cookie row.
Press spacebar to toggle the selection.

You can also hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> pressed and then press the arrow up/down
key to quickly select consecutive rows (or unselect, if the initial row was
unselected).

### Bulk selection of visible cookies
The default "Select all" button selects all cookies in the search results.
To only select the cookies that are visible on the screen, go to the
"More actions" menu and change the "Bulk selection" option from  
"Select all = select all results" to  
"Select all = select visible results".

After doing this, the "Select all" button is replaced with "Select visible".

Because mobile devices do usually not have a physical keyboard or mouse, this
button is usually the fastest way to process a large number of cookies.


# Browser-specific notes
## Chrome
No special notes. I haven't published the extension to the Chrome Web Store.

## Firefox for Desktop
Install from: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/a-cookie-manager

### All versions

No known bugs or limitations.

### Version 58 and earlier
The cookies API in Firefox has several bugs that makes it unsuitable for
modifying (private) cookies. In these cases, after a prompt, the extension will
work around the bugs by initiating a request to the sites of the cookies, and
modify the cookies when the server sends any response (and abort the request as
soon as possible).
If the server is unreachable, the cookie cannot be modified.

As of Firefox 56, no work-arounds are needed when the browser runs with the
default settings.

When First Party Isolation is enabled (this is the case in the TOR Browser),
the work-around is needed, until https://bugzil.la/1381197 is fixed.

And until https://bugzil.la/1381197 is fixed, a "NID" cookie for the google.com
is hidden from the cookie manager. This is because the cookie is in a cookie jar
used for Safebrowsing, and this jar is completely isolated from the rest of the
browser, including extensions (https://bugzil.la/1362834).

### Version 55 and earlier
To edit private browsing cookies, the cookie manager must be opened in a private
browsing window. If you try to edit a private browsing cookie of a
site on the Tracking protection blocklist, then you must temporarily disable
Tracking protection, via the "Tracking protection" checkbox at Settings >
Privacy (or open a new tab in a private browsing window and flip the
"Tracking Protection" switch at the bottom).

## Firefox for Android
Install from: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/a-cookie-manager

### Version 56 and later
There are no known bugs for the default use case.

### Version 55 and earlier
To edit private browsing cookies, the cookie manager must be opened in a
private browsing tab (select the URL in the location bar, open an incognito
tab, paste the URL and go). If you try to edit a private browsing cookie of a
site on the Tracking protection blocklist, then you must temporarily disable
Tracking protection, via the "Tracking protection" checkbox at Settings >
Privacy.

### Version 54 and earlier
There Cookie Manager cannot be opened via the menu (https://bugzil.la/1331742).

### Version 53 and earlier
The Cookie manager cannot be opened upon start-up. Tap on the icon in the
address bar to open the cookie manager. Due to a bug in Firefox this icon is
very small, unfortunately.
